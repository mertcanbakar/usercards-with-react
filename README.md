In this project, I pulled user information from an API with the help of React.

Below is the URL I used for the API
https://randomuser.me/api/?results=5

In this project I used 'axios' to send request to URL for API.

Here's what I did when pulling info from this API:
1) First I created a Component for a simple header and then I imported this component into my app.js file.
2) I created a different component as a main container for the User Cards I will create.
3) I created the information I want for these cards in the UsersInfo component.
4) I have stored all these component files in a specific folder.

Finally, I completed the project by making the necessary style operations.
